# CS210ProgrammingLanguages
Repository for class project 

The purpose of this project was to read a text file and output the frequency that items show up from the file. The three 3 displays
needed to show an individual item + item's frequency, all items + their frequency, or a histogram of all items + their frequency. The
program needed to display a menu to the end user to pick what to display or to ext the program. The program needed to pull data from a 
text file and organize the items in a text file and count those items to determine their frequency in the text file. The program also
needed to generate another text file that outputs the frequencies of the items as a backup text file for the data.

I think I set up the ItemFinder class well. This was to ensure a minimal amount of code exists in main().

I think maybe make another class for userChoice and have main() refer to that class when userInput is entered. This would reduce
the amount of code in main().

The part I found most challenging was adding the different methods to my ItemFinder class. Making sure I covered each menu option and making sure
each option corresponded to the appropriate method and that each method would execute appropriately.

I think creating a class is most beneficial moving forward for other projects.

By adding comments and examples to my comments, it helps make the code more readable so other people can understand why I put in a specific code.
Also by using the appropriate white space, my code looks clean and readable, even without the in-line comments.
